	NumeRe may read images using the <code>imread</code> command as <a href="nhlp://datagrid?frame=new">datagrids</a> into memory. The usual image formats are supported: JPEG, BMP, GIF, TIFF, ... To load the image, one calls the command together with the image's filename:<codeblock>imread PATH/TO/FILE.png</codeblock>
	Very large images probably may not be loaded to memory. A Workaround in this case might be to clear the cache completely using <code>clear</code>.
	As default the image is loaded to the cache <code>image()</code>, which is created automatically if it's not present. Using the option <code>target=CACHE()</code> one may select another cache as target for the command.
