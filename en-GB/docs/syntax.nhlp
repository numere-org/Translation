	The NumeRe command syntax orients itself at one basic scheme. This scheme devides all keywords in three categories: commands, parameters and options. (However, this assignment is only strict in some few cases.)
	The common scheme is as follows:<codeblock>COMMAND [EXPRESSION] [-PARAMETER[=VALUE] [OPTIONS]]</codeblock>Here all objects in brackets are optional values, which are not mandatory in every case. Due to error tolerance some parameters may be used as commands (and the other way around) and the order of options and parameters are not strict as well, as long as they are separated with a minus sign from the command. (For instance, <code>data -load=FILE</code> and <code>load -data=FILE</code> are synonymes)
	Exceptions are commands, which contain an expression (e.g. <code>plot</code> or <code>integrate</code>). Here all options have to follow the first parameter <code>-set</code>. And also listing and configuration setting commands (<code>set -PARAMETER=VALUE</code> and <code>list -PARAMETER</code>) may not changed in their order as well.
	Commands are case sensitive, but options and parameters are not. In common, every NumeRe command will be a lower case written word.
	NumeRe may not be a clairvoyant, although it was programmed quite sophisticately. However, the NumeRe documentation will be called, if a command was invoked with wrong or too few parameters, or at least a corresponding note will be displayed that the input had some errors.
