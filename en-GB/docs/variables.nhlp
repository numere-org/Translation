		Variables are one of the core functionalities of NumeRe. They may store values, which may be easily used at a later point. Their names may be composed out of an arbitrary combination of numbers, letters and underscores, as long as they do not start with a number. They may even carry the same name as a function, because functions are identified by their parentheses:<verbatim>Variable "func"  vs.  function "func()"</verbatim>
		Variables will be declared, if their desired name is entered directly. Optionally, values may be assigned to these variables during initialization in the form<codeblock>VARIABLE = VALUE</codeblock> Otherwise they will be initialized with the value of 0.
		In the case that an unknown variable is used in an expression, it will be initialized with the value of 0.
		There is a special variable called <code>ans{}</code> (a so-called <a href="nhlp://cluster?frame=new">cluster</a>), which automatically stores the last calculated result. For historical reasons the variable <code>ans</code> is available as well, but its functionality is quite restricted in comparison. In addition, the four standard variables <code>x, y, z</code> and <code>t</code> are predefined and known from start-up.
		<a href="nhlp://table?frame=new">Tables</a> are another variable type in NumeRe. Those use a similar signature as functions, but they are capable of using the interval operator <code>A:B</code>. As default, loaded data is found inside of the table <code>data()</code>. Another table is <code>table()</code>, which is available per default. New tables may be created with the command <a href="nhlp://new?frame=new"><code>new</code></a>, or if they are generated as a copy of an already existing table:<codeblock>NEWTAB() = OLDTAB()</codeblock>
		<example desc="Declaring of the variable x with value 1:">
			x = 1
			ans = 1
		</example>
