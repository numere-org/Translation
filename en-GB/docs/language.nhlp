	You may add own language files to NumeRe, which are present in the NumeRe root directory in the subfolders <code>&lt;&gt;/user/docs</code> and <code>&lt;&gt;/user/lang</code>. As template you may copy the standard language files out ouf <code>&lt;&gt;/docs</code> and <code>&lt;&gt;/lang</code>.
	The language files are simple text files. The actual language files are located in <code>.../lang/*.nlng</code> and define all displayed language strings. They are combined out of three types: the so-called identifiers (in uppercase letters an left to the equal sign), the translated language strings (right of the equal sign) and the placeholders (surrounded by doubled percentage signs). Comments are introduced with a <code>#</code> at the beginning and all whitespaces, which are surrounding the equal sign, will be ignored:<codeblock>#Comment\nIDENTIFIER=translated language string with %%PLACEHOLDER%%</codeblock>
	Placeholders may have one of two types: placeholders only consisting numbers, will be filled during the execution of NumeRe with information (e.g. a filename during an error), placeholders consisting of letters, will be replaced during loading time (during startup) with the language string of the referenced identifier:<codeblock>STR=language string\nIDENTIFIER=translated %%STR%% with %%PLACEHOLDER%%</codeblock>
	You may add own identifier and own placeholders, but you only may use them for the placeholders, which will be replaced during loading time. In addition, we would like to beg you that you use the prefix <code>USER_*</code> for your identifier so that they don't interfere with standard ones.
	The files in <code>.../docs/*.nhlp</code> are the articles of the NumeRe documentation and are written in a derivation of the XML format. See "help documentation" for further information about this file format.
	To add the language, all copied files have to be translated. Note that NumeRe is not capable of interpreting unicode yet. Therefore you should not use special characters.
