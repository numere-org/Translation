	If you want to display a data set currently in memory, you may use the command <code>show</code>:<codeblock>show DATA(I1:I2,J1:J2)</codeblock>The content of the data set will be presented as a clean table.
	Depending on your preferences and the size of the the data set, NumeRe won't display the whole data set, but a coarse overlook, which shows the first few and the last few lines. This behavior may be modified globally with the configuration setting <code>set -compact</code> or it may be overwritten for the current case with the command's variant <code>showf</code>.
	Displaying very large data sets may need some time, because formatted outputs are really time costly operations.
