	NumeRe contains an algorithm for fast fourier transforming of data sets (<em>fft</em>), which may separate data sets for analysis in their corresponding frequencies. This algorithm may be startet with the command <code>fft</code>, to which the data rows must be passed in the following way:<codeblock>fft DATAOBJECT(I1:I2,J1:J2)</codeblock>
	NumeRe expects at least two columns for a fourier transform: the axis values (Time or frequency, respectively) and the corresponding amplitude. If three columns are passed, they will be interpreted as axis values, amplitude and phase, or---if the additional option <code>complex</code> has been passed---as axis values, real and imaginary part of the amplitude. The option <code>complex</code> doesn't have any effect, if only two columns have been passed.
	The result of the fourier transform will be stored as multiple new data rows in the current cache (or directly in <code>cache()</code>, if the data were taken from <code>data()</code>). Sticking to the default, NumeRe will generate three columns: frequency [Hz], amplitude and phase [rad]. Using the additional option <code>complex</code>, NumeRe will generate the real and imaginary parts of the amplitude instead of the absolut value of the amplitude and the corresponding phase and save them to the cache.
	NumeRe may initiate inverse fourier transform of data sets, if the additional option <code>inverse</code> is passed.
