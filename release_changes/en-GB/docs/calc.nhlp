	NumeRe's calculator mode is a numerical calculation framework, designed for "input-output" operations.
	In a very restricted way, the calculator mode can be compared to Octave (although NumeRe will be constantly extended).
	The calculator mode can be started and ended with the command <code>mode</code> (depending on its current state).
