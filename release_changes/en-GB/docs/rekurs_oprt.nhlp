	NumeRe may use the following recursive operators: <code>+=</code>, <code>-=</code>, <code>*=</code>, <code>/=</code> and <code>^=</code>. These operators are abbreviatons for:<codeblock>VAR += EXPRESSION &lt;=&gt; VAR = VAR + (EXPRESSION)</codeblock>and similar for the other operators.
	This may prevent you from having to type very much. The recursive operators will be transformed to their long variants internally, to prevent ambigousity.
