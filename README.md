# Translation
This repository contains the necessary translation files for NumeRe. Feel free to supply your won translation, if you want to. We have some good resources, which might help you right here: [HowTo: Create Language Strings](https://github.com/numere-org/NumeRe/wiki/HowTo:-Create-Language-Strings)

Have also a look into the built-in documentation, which contains some additional information.
